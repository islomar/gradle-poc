## Personal notes
* You can visualize and debug your build with build scans
* A project includes a collections of tasks. Gradle tasks are organized into categories.
* `gradle tasks`: it shows you which tasks are available, which ones you can use.
* `gradle wrapper`: generates a Gradle wrapper file. The wrapper is a small script and supporting jar and properties file that allows a user to execute Gradle tasks even if they donâ€™t already have Gradle installed.
* **IMPORTANT**: While Gradle versions are very good about supporting backward compatibility, using a wrapper ensures that the user is working with a version of Gradle that the project creator supports, and is therefore considered a good practice.
* Execute all the tasks: `./gradlew tasks --all`
* Execute the copy task: `./gradlew copy`

## Best practices
* Use SDKMAN
* Use a wrapper
