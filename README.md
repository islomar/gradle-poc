## Personal notes
* You can visualize and debug your build with build scans
* A project includes a collections of tasks. Gradle tasks are organized into categories.
* `gradle wrapper`: generates a Gradle wrapper file. The wrapper is a small script and supporting jar and properties file that allows a user to execute Gradle tasks even if they donâ€™t already have Gradle installed.
